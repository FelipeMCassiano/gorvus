# Guidelines
 **Create a Single PR for Content Additions**: If you are planning to contribute by adding content to the roadmaps, I recommend you to clone the repository, add content to the content directory of the gorvus and create a single PR to make it easier for me to review and merge the PR.

- **Write meaningful commit messages**

- **Look at the existing issues/pull requests before opening new ones**
